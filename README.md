# Quiz App Challenge

The goal of this challenge was to design a coding quiz that mimics something you might come across during the process of a job interview.

The user clicks start and has 1 minute to answer the 5 questions. If an answer is correct, the user is presented with the next question. If an answer is incorrect, the quiz will still move along, but 10 seconds will be subtracted from the timer. 

Upon completion, the user is prompted to enter their initials to save their latest high score. Local storage is used to display this information.
